/*
You are working on a counter function. Every time the function is called, it
_should_ add 1 to the counter, and then print out the counter's current value.
Your goal is to analyze two possible solutions, and then debug the function so
it produces the correct output.

Example 1: Predict what will be printed when `incrementCounter1()` is called.
What will happen when `incrementCounter1()` is called 3 times in a row?

Run the code, `node problems/02-debugging.js` and compare the output to your
prediction.

Example 2: Your friend tried to debug this code, and came up with the second
solution. Predict what will be printed when `incrementCounter2()` is called.

What will happen when `incrementCounter2()` is called 3 times in a row?
Comment out the `console.log()`s for example 1 and uncomment the
`console.log()`s for example 2.

Run the code, `node problems/02-debugging.js` and compare the output to your
prediction.

Use what you know about about scope (local, global, and block) to debug the
`incrementCounter2()` function.

Run the code again. If successful, you should see the counter print out 1,
2, 3...incrementing the counter by 1 with each additional function call.
